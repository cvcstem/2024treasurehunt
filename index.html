        <p1>We've had an anonymous tip-off that Robert Russel's email server used aes-256-cbc with a default IV of 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 in hex. Could this prove to be helpful given previous clues regarding decryption keys or passwords of sorts??</p1><br>
        <p1>Tip-off 2: have you tried base64?</p1>
